This project was originally written in C++ for Win32, using the WinAPI as
graphical interface. The Task was to draw a simulated scene consisting of
a tractor and a dynamic count of wagons behind it. The tractor should
drive on an ellipse, pulling the wagons. You should have the ability to
manipulate the scene by setting internal variables, like the radi of the
ellipse, the speed, etc. While the simulation is in progress, you should
be able to add or remove wagons by pressing a key, and zoom in or out.

I thought this would be a nice project to reimplement in Ada using Lumen.
